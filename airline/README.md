# Airline
This DAML model shows a process to issue airline tickets, and manage the seat allocation of a flight. The process is privacy preserving in the sense that passengers don't get to see each other's tickets. The process enables transactional, self-service seat choices, requiring passengers to know about each other, even before they get on the flight.
